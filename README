Controlable multiprocessing pool

A small module for parallelizing data processing using queues and processes.

Common case to use:
1) Create queues.
2) Create processes to generate jobs, process jobs, save results.
3) Start processes.
4) Wait for specific processes, process groups, or queues to finish.

No new queues are expected.

You can organize non-linear processing of tasks: return to the queue, transfer to different queues depending on the conditions, etc.
